        <p>Whenever there is a full moon in the sky, my dad recites the poem from the movie:</p>
        <p><i>Even a man who is pure of heart,<br>
           and says his prayers by night,<br>
           may become a wolf when the wolfbane blooms,<br>
           and the autumn moon is bright.</i>
